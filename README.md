# NameEntityRecognition 
🚀 Introducing my latest NLP project: Named Entity Recognition 🌟
🔥 Hey everyone, I'm thrilled to share my new project with you all! In this venture, I've delved into the fascinating realm of Natural Language Processing (NLP) to bring you a cutting-edge solution called "Named Entity Recognition."
📚 What's it all about? Well, I've poured my heart and soul into this project, crafting every line of code using the incredible Streamlit framework. And guess what? You can experience it firsthand right on your local host! 🌐
🔗 Simply head over to my project, where you'll be greeted with two awesome choices. The first one lets you input text that will be expertly tokenized, and the second one is where the magic really happens—Name Entity Recognition! 🧐
🌍 You won't believe your eyes as the project skillfully identifies essential entities like places, dates, organizations, monetary values, and more from your text. But hold on, that's not all! It goes the extra mile by visually labeling them for a more interactive experience. 🏷️
